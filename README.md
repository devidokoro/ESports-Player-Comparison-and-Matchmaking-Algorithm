Created a rudimentary Java program that takes input for a user's CS2 statistics and compares them with pro players' statistics. These statistics include their elo rating, total lifetime amount of kills, and their total lifetime games played. The program accepts these inputs and calculates the user's average kills per game. Also created a matchmaking algorithm that utilizes the user's obtained statistics and matches them up with 4 other teammates against 5 opponents, whose collective team elo is similar to the collective elo of the user's assembled team.
