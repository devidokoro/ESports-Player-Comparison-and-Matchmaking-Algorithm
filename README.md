Created a rudimentary Java program that takes input for a user's CS2 statistics and compares them with pro players' statistics. These statistics include their elo rating, total lifetime kills, and their total lifetime games played. The program accepts these inputs, calculates the user's average kills per game, and compares the user's elo rating to those of the pro players. Also created a matchmaking algorithm that utilizes the user's obtained statistics and matches them up with 4 other teammates against 5 opponents, whose collective team elo is similar to the collective elo of the user's assembled team.
