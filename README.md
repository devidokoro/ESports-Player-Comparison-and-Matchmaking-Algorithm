Created a rudimentary Java program that takes input for a user's CS2 statistics and compares them with pro players' statistics. These statistics include FACEIT elo and the total amount of kills they acquired within their last 10 games. The program accepts these inputs and calculates the user's average kills per game. Also created a matchmaking algorithm that utilizes the user's obtained statistics and matches them up with 4 other teammates against 5 opponents, whose collective team elo is similar to the user's collective team elo.
